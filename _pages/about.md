I'm a first-year master's student at the [School of Electronic and lnformation Engineering](https://www.ee.buaa.edu.cn/), [Beihang University (BUAA)](https://www.buaa.edu.cn/).  
My research interests lie in **spatio-temporal data mining**, with a focus on temporal modeling, trajectory analysis, and intelligent systems.
